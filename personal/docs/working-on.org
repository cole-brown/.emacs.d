#+TITLE:     Working On: (already out of date...)
#+AUTHOR:    Cole Brown
#+EMAIL:     git@spydez.com
#+DATE:      [2019-03-05 Tue]

* Soon™ things [0/2]

 - [ ] commands/hydra for putting personalized markers down (TODO, "Left off here.", etc)
   - hook into... save? magit? to check for,complain about markers so they hopefully don't
     get checked in?
     - Maybe another command to convert them to impersonal/delete.
 - [ ] Try evil mode?
   - This will take... years?... to try properly maybe I think?

* Next things?
:PROPERTIES:
:VISIBILITY: all
:END:

  - [ ] To Do: [0/8]
    - [ ] fill-*
      - fill-paragraph to a better keybind than M-q?
      - fill-region to a keybind?
      - key-chord hydra for fill-* commands?
    - [ ] Is there a command to list out applicable yasnippets?
    - [ ] ag, ack, gack, gawk, your mom, grep, something?
    - [ ] org-journal - try it out?
      - https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal
      - try w/ encryption (fix gpg again again... again... -_-)
        - https://arenzana.org/2019/04/emacs-org-mode/
    - [ ] a per-device way of saying "off", "minimum", or "full" for features?
      - e.g. want full C# dev env at work, but minimum at home? Set it that way and
        language server, other external tools won't bother - just code hilighting maybe.
      - e.g.2. want rust or w/e flavor of the month catches my eye at home but
        none of it at work
    - [ ] configure-crypt needs babying... again... (again... (again?..))
    - [ ] remove references/?
      - Or put those files in repo... useless files now when not on whatever comp I downloaded em on.
      - ref files were for files that were/are very useful on their own and so preserving them for
        a decade or whatever from now would be useful.
        - Some of my old .emacs is just references to dead web links... not useful.
    - [ ] default-directory var for pretending a file is elsewhere

* DONE [2019-08-09] A list of things that are done now

:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from              [2019-08-09 Fri 10:45]
:END:

  - [X] To Do: [9/9]
    - [X] csetq vs setq all the places? see zeroth-funcs
      - csetq vs setq vs jamming everything into (use-package ... :custom ...)
      - I think this:
        - (use-package ...) is great if not too much trouble.
        - customize-set-variable for single custom vars
        - custom-set-variables for multiple custom vars
      - [X] move custom.el so those three options work without us caring about custom.el spam.
      - [X] remove csetq defun
      - [X] remove all csetq
      - [X] remove any custom-set-variables? Change to customize-set-variable.
    - [X] A command for searching explainshell.com with a string
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b2uqdm/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/eiv75b8
      - Uh... already have this. Apparently.
    - [X] have recentf ignore elpa dir?
      - [X] It's not actually been a problem in a long time so I'm doing:
        - [X] Meh.
        - [X] No for now.
    - [X] Have my taskspace write this somewhere:
          "mkdir <00-my-remote-temp-dir>/2019-07-22_0_<task-desc>"
      - Add to the notes.org? Well, but it needs generated from name.
    - [X] Elisp command to call shell with string (shell command(s)) and print
      output. See: 2019-03_tasks.org
      - For routine/simple checking up on servers without having to leave emacs.
      - [X] Figure out command/elisp.
        - See: 2019-03_tasks.org
      - [X] Make an interactive (spydez/... or (spydez/domain/work...
            or whatever command. (<server-name>...)?
    - [X] kill buffer cmd w/ no-kill list
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b2uqdm/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/eiv960e
    - [X] this hydra looks useful maybe:
      - https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Emacs#Transpose
    - [X] org-mode stuff to look at:
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b90xc5/orgmode_your_life/
    - [X] taskspace.el
          feature?: temp/workspace dated/numbered dirs
      - e.g. first/only dir of the day: 2019-04-05_0_<description>
      - second: 2019-04-05_1_<2nd-description>
      - '_' as date/num/desc separator
      - '-' as date/word sep (space illegal/replaced)
      - func to travel to/open in dired mode the directory
        - and create it if non-existant


* DONE [2019-07-18] A list of things that are done now
CLOSED: [2019-07-18 Thu 17:28]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from              [2019-07-18 Thu 17:28]
:END:

  - More things to do: [14/14]
    - [X] rename spy/<datestamp> funcs? or delete?
      - have:
        - spydez/timestamp-ISO
        - spydez/timestamp-ORG
        - spydez/dd-mon-yy
        - spydez/yyyy-mm-dd
      - want?
        - spydez/datetime/{ISO-datetime, ORG, US-human, ISO-date-sortable} ???
    - [X] yascroll.el
      - https://github.com/m2ym/yascroll-el
      - Meh. A bug since 2015 still exists in it that would require me to require cl before its stuff so nope.
    - [X] https://github.com/nhoffman/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.org
    - [X] finish trawling zzazmboni config:
      - left off here: https://zzamboni.org/post/my-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/#literate-programming-using-org-babel
    - [X] https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2427/how-to-test-rest-api-with-emacs
    - [X] More dates in org headers? Created, updated...
      - I think just "date" for now...?
    - [X] templates?
      - [X] for org headers?
      - [X] for blank .emacs.d config file?
    - [X] A more canonical place for the org file dates?
      - "#+DATE:" is actually used
    - [X] Notes/Issues
      - [X] configure-files-and-folders notes removed into its issue file notes
      - [X] epa/gpg notes into issues, for now?
    - [X] all-the-icons working enough for me now?
      - Uh... sure. And there's a todo or two up for the rest...
    - [X] file structure has changed...
    - [X] Also on bootstrap-debug-early todo
    - [X] update notes/*.org?
      - Think some todo'd placeholders have been done.
      - Still one todo but its full of temp tab links
    - [X] get yasnippets to load for org-mode, at least?
      my 'header' template doesn't work until you poke yasnippets a bit.


* A list of things to consider working on

  1) some sort of search for this .emacs.d project
     - [ ] Right now grep in projectile project doesn't like find command it generates.
       - Command works when pasted into (git for windows) bash, and emacs knows about bash...?
       - Command works in M-x shell.
       - Hm... Not sure right now.

  2) Projectile, use this .emacs.d project as test/tutorial?
     - working on it

  3) fuzzy stuff

  4) ...

  5) other note files...

  6) look into: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/audffp/tip_how_to_use_a_stable_and_fast_environment_to/

  7) hi

* look at these:

https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3kqt6e/2_easy_little_known_steps_to_speed_up_emacs_start/

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OptimizingEmacsStartup
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ProfileDotEmacs

* packages to consider

** Dashboard

(use-package dashboard
  :config
  (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))

https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8jaflq/tip_how_to_use_your_dashboard_properly/

** Ace Jump Mode

Looks like it's Avy vs Ace Jump. Not sure if I want either. Avy seems newer?

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AceJump
(use-package ace-jump-mode
  :bind
  ("C-c SPC" . ace-jump-mode))

$ find . -iname "*.el" -o -iname "*.org" | grep -v "/var/" | grep -v "/pre-no-littering/" | grep -v "/manual-package-archive/" | grep -v "/elpa/" | xargs grep "ace-jump"
./personal/docs/references/nhoffman.init.org:replacement for ace-jump-mode.
./personal/init/config/configure-hydra.el:    ;; Not using avy right now. Similar to ace-jump or easymotion.

** ediff

Do I need this with magit? Or at all?

(use-package ediff
  :config
  (setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
  (setq-default ediff-highlight-all-diffs 'nil)
  (setq ediff-diff-options "-w"))

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ediff/
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EdiffMode
https://oremacs.com/2015/01/17/setting-up-ediff/
  - has reasons to use with magit

** helm search things

(use-package wgrep)

(use-package helm-ag)

(use-package helm-git-grep)

** page break line

https://github.com/purcell/page-break-lines

Don't think I see page breaks all that often/at all.

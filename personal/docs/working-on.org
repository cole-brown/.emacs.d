* Things I Want, Non-Emacs-Related

** pretty output library helper

features:
  - indentation levels
  - easy columns
  - easy left/right/center alignment
  - Easy "ensure we have N empty lines above what's about to print"
  - easy line decorators ("-----", etc) of static or dynamic widths
    - based on what's above, or below...
      - Maybe "decorate this like so: (above, below, bracket), style, size"
  - auto figuring out of how much width a label should be
    - padding available, obvs.

Would want it in... python, C#, elisp, every other language I do...

*** Names?

neater
  - cuz... made more orderly/tidy?

polh
  - pretty output library helper

mis
  - make it so

* Win 10 App to Check Out Maybe

FancyZones:
  - Tiling window manager. Save/restore layouts?
  - https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/src/modules/fancyzones

* Packages to Check Out Maybe

leaf (use-package alternative):
  - https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el
  - https://melpa.org/#/leaf

CamelCase <-> snake_case:
  - https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection

Aggressive Indent Mode:
  - https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode

Eval In REPL:
  - https://github.com/kaz-yos/eval-in-repl
  - elisp, python, shell, buch of languages I don't know...

Save/switch between window configs.
  - kind of a tiling window manager
  - "Eyebrowse"
  - https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse

Auto-balance window width/layout:
  - "Zoom"
  - https://github.com/cyrus-and/zoom

Stripe Buffer:
  - different background colors for even and odd lines
  - Can have 3rd color for current line when combined w/ hl-line-mode
  - https://github.com/sabof/stripe-buffer
  - Looks good for dired-mode.

Page Break Lines:
  - https://github.com/purcell/page-break-lines
  - Don't think I see page breaks all that often/at all.
    - But it does look nicer.

Company-Jedi:
  - python auto-complete package Jedi for Company package users.
  - https://github.com/syohex/emacs-company-jedi

* Soon™ things [0/2]

 - [ ] commands/hydra for putting personalized markers down (TODO, "Left off here.", etc)
   - hook into... save? magit? to check for,complain about markers so they hopefully don't
     get checked in?
     - Maybe another command to convert them to impersonal/delete.
 - [ ] Try evil mode?
   - This will take... years?... to try properly maybe I think?

* Next things?
:PROPERTIES:
:VISIBILITY: all
:END:

  - [-] To Do: [4/12]
    - [ ] use-package: Find all ":bind" and split into multiple ":bind" sections.
      - One for global.
      - One for each map.
    - [ ] use-package: rm setq
      - Find all setq, convert to ":custom" sections.
    - [ ] use-package: whitespace & neatness.
      - Two blank lines between keyword sections unless very simple.
      - Sections should have ";;---" around their keywords unless very simple.
    - [ ] feature request: changable helpful buffer name format
      - (defun helpful--buffer (symbol callable-p)
      - Or, perhaps, a fix and pull request?
    - [-] Fancy checkboxes (<- like that) lose fancy boxyness when buffer has mismatched quotations or something
      - [X] double quote def work. Take out one of these and see. ""
      - [X] Started issue at (spydez/help/issue/visit "org-mode" "prettify-symbols.org")
      - [ ] See if issue is in other modes, or just org-mode?
      - [ ] Turn off for now?
    - [ ] configure-crypt needs babying... again... (again... (again?..))
      - [ ] org-journal: add encryption (fix gpg again again... again... -_-)
        - https://arenzana.org/2019/04/emacs-org-mode/
    - [ ] default-directory var for pretending a file is elsewhere
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b2uqdm/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/eivtuo4
    - [ ] LSP mode for python
      - more work to get it to... useful and not annoying?
      - Lines judder and jump a bit - may be lsp-ui causing it?
    - [ ] a per-device way of saying "off", "minimum", or "full" for features?
      - e.g. want full C# dev env at work, but minimum at home? Set it that way and
        language server, other external tools won't bother - just code hilighting maybe.
      - e.g.2. want rust or w/e flavor of the month catches my eye at home but
        none of it at work
    - [X] Get yasnippets off TAB... getting annoying with all its one letter expansions.
    - [X] Company complete (I think) - proper case completion?
    - [X] ag, ack, gack, gawk, your mom, grep, something?
      - [X] ripgrep https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
        - Added ripgrep to Windows' PATH env var. Want it on bash cmd line too...
      - [X] w/ deadgrep? https://github.com/Wilfred/deadgrep
      - [X] Restart emacs and test.
    - [X] interactive function for code->issue doc linkage
      - M-x whatever -> prints/returns expanded filename
      - C-u M-x whatever -> visits file
      - First stab. Not interactive, but I need multiple args.
        - `spydez/help/issue/path' and `spydez/help/issue/visit'

  - [X] To Do: [7/7]
    - [X] Is there a command to list out applicable yasnippets?
      - M-x yas-insert-snippet
        - aka `C-c & C-s'
      - Also made spydez/yas/list for calling that.
        - But my snippets don't show up sometimes - order is weird. Search for '<spy'.
    - [X] wsbutler - ignore line at point completely
      - Something fucky is happening and my advice function only works if
        there's a message to slow it down...?
      - Complicated. See [[file:issues/whitespace-and-butler/bug-info.el::;;%20-*-%20mode:%20emacs-lisp;%20lexical-binding:%20t%20-*-][issue]] and [[file:~/.emacs.d/personal/init/config/configure-whitespace.el::;;%20Error%20seems%20a%20layer%20deeper%20in%20applying%20`buffer-display-table'%20to%20buffer...][config]]
      - I could just have it skip over any EOL whitespace checking on point's line if point's in the whitespace maybe? That sounds complicated...
    - [X] something subtler than magenta for the too-long lines from whitespace-mode?
      - Something that works well with comments (green) and normal (white)
    - [X] use-package helpful
    - [X] null/temp custom.el
      - Will package-selected-packages like this?
      - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9rrhy8/emacsers_with_beautiful_initel_files_what_about/e8jaxxs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][temp file for custom]]
        - No. Trying `null-device' instead.
          - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9rrhy8/emacsers_with_beautiful_initel_files_what_about/e8juc8v
    - [X] Magit - don't ignore whitespace in commit/diff
    - [X] different whitespace-style list for org-mode
      - [X] First stab failed. Try again.

  - [X] To Do: [5/5]
    - [X] TODO: move most of org-mode stuff to :config or :hook as appropriate
      - [X] Put hook into :init as its own defun
    - [X] org-mode: Does the pretty boxes thing only work on this because it only
      works on the 1st org-mode file/buffer?
      - was a derived major mode thing
      - [X] pretty boxes
      - [X] Same for the pretty bullets... why so inconsistent?
      - [X] Try the font-lock thing for bullets in the hook function maybe if
           :config doesn't work?
    - [X] org-journal - try it out?
      - https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal
    - [X] remove references/?
      - Or put those files in repo... useless files now when not on whatever comp I downloaded em on.
      - ref files were for files that were/are very useful on their own and so preserving them for
        a decade or whatever from now would be useful.
        - Some of my old .emacs is just references to dead web links... not useful.
    - [X] fill-*
      - fill-paragraph to a better keybind than M-q?
      - fill-region to a keybind?
      - [X] key-chord hydra for fill-* commands?

  - [X] To Do: [9/9]
    - [X] csetq vs setq all the places? see zeroth-funcs
      - csetq vs setq vs jamming everything into (use-package ... :custom ...)
      - I think this:
        - (use-package ...) is great if not too much trouble.
        - customize-set-variable for single custom vars
        - custom-set-variables for multiple custom vars
      - [X] move custom.el so those three options work without us caring about custom.el spam.
      - [X] remove csetq defun
      - [X] remove all csetq
      - [X] remove any custom-set-variables? Change to customize-set-variable.
    - [X] A command for searching explainshell.com with a string
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b2uqdm/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/eiv75b8
      - Uh... already have this. Apparently.
    - [X] have recentf ignore elpa dir?
      - [X] It's not actually been a problem in a long time so I'm doing:
        - [X] Meh.
        - [X] No for now.
    - [X] Have my taskspace write this somewhere:
          "mkdir <00-my-remote-temp-dir>/2019-07-22_0_<task-desc>"
      - Add to the notes.org? Well, but it needs generated from name.
    - [X] Elisp command to call shell with string (shell command(s)) and print
      output. See: 2019-03_tasks.org
      - For routine/simple checking up on servers without having to leave emacs.
      - [X] Figure out command/elisp.
        - See: 2019-03_tasks.org
      - [X] Make an interactive (spydez/... or (spydez/domain/work...
            or whatever command. (<server-name>...)?
    - [X] kill buffer cmd w/ no-kill list
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b2uqdm/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/eiv960e
    - [X] this hydra looks useful maybe:
      - https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Emacs#Transpose
    - [X] org-mode stuff to look at:
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/b90xc5/orgmode_your_life/
    - [X] taskspace.el
          feature?: temp/workspace dated/numbered dirs
      - e.g. first/only dir of the day: 2019-04-05_0_<description>
      - second: 2019-04-05_1_<2nd-description>
      - '_' as date/num/desc separator
      - '-' as date/word sep (space illegal/replaced)
      - func to travel to/open in dired mode the directory
        - and create it if non-existant

  - More things to do: [14/14]
    - [X] rename spy/<datestamp> funcs? or delete?
      - have:

        - spydez/timestamp-ORG
        - spydez/dd-mon-yy
        - spydez/yyyy-mm-dd

    - [X] yascroll.el
      - https://github.com/m2ym/yascroll-el
      - Meh. A bug since 2015 still exists in it that would require me to require cl before its stuff so nope.
    - [X] https://github.com/nhoffman/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.org
    - [X] finish trawling zzazmboni config:
      - left off here: https://zzamboni.org/post/my-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/#literate-programming-using-org-babel
    - [X] https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2427/how-to-test-rest-api-with-emacs
    - [X] More dates in org headers? Created, updated...
      - I think just "date" for now...?
    - [X] templates?
      - [X] for org headers?
      - [X] for blank .emacs.d config file?
    - [X] A more canonical place for the org file dates?
      - "#+DATE:" is actually used
    - [X] Notes/Issues
      - [X] configure-files-and-folders notes removed into its issue file notes
      - [X] epa/gpg notes into issues, for now?
    - [X] all-the-icons working enough for me now?
      - Uh... sure. And there's a todo or two up for the rest...
    - [X] file structure has changed...
    - [X] Also on bootstrap-debug-early todo
    - [X] update notes/*.org?
      - Think some todo'd placeholders have been done.
      - Still one todo but its full of temp tab links
    - [X] get yasnippets to load for org-mode, at least?
      my 'header' template doesn't work until you poke yasnippets a bit.


* A list of things to consider working on

  1) some sort of search for this .emacs.d project
     - [ ] Right now grep in projectile project doesn't like find command it generates.
       - Command works when pasted into (git for windows) bash, and emacs knows about bash...?
       - Command works in M-x shell.
       - Hm... Not sure right now.

  2) Projectile, use this .emacs.d project as test/tutorial?
     - working on it

  3) fuzzy stuff

  4) ...

  5) other note files...

  6) look into: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/audffp/tip_how_to_use_a_stable_and_fast_environment_to/

  7) hi

* look at these:

https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3kqt6e/2_easy_little_known_steps_to_speed_up_emacs_start/

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OptimizingEmacsStartup
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ProfileDotEmacs

* (old) packages to consider

** Dashboard

(use-package dashboard
  :config
  (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))

https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8jaflq/tip_how_to_use_your_dashboard_properly/

** Ace Jump Mode

Looks like it's Avy vs Ace Jump. Not sure if I want either. Avy seems newer?

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AceJump
(use-package ace-jump-mode
  :bind
  ("C-c SPC" . ace-jump-mode))

$ find . -iname "*.el" -o -iname "*.org" | grep -v "/var/" | grep -v "/pre-no-littering/" | grep -v "/manual-package-archive/" | grep -v "/elpa/" | xargs grep "ace-jump"
./personal/docs/references/nhoffman.init.org:replacement for ace-jump-mode.
./personal/init/config/configure-hydra.el:    ;; Not using avy right now. Similar to ace-jump or easymotion.

** ediff

Do I need this with magit? Or at all?

(use-package ediff
  :config
  (setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
  (setq-default ediff-highlight-all-diffs 'nil)
  (setq ediff-diff-options "-w"))

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ediff/
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EdiffMode
https://oremacs.com/2015/01/17/setting-up-ediff/
  - has reasons to use with magit

** helm search things

(use-package wgrep)

(use-package helm-ag)

(use-package helm-git-grep)

Treemacs had an error on first attempt to run it.

* Rough timeline leading up:

  1) Many things happened. Noteably I added `no-littering' to my .emacs config.
  2) Added treemacs as a use-package statement.
  3) Package errors of some sort.
     - Did the usual refresh/update to fix.
  4) Added treemacs-projectile, treemacs-icons-dired, and treemacs-magit with use-package.
  5) Tried `M-x treemacs-find-file' and `M-x treemacs'. Both had an error:
     condition-case: Opening output file: No such file or directory,
     <path-to>/.emacs.d/.cache/treemacs-persist-at-last-error
  6) Suspected it might be no-littering.
  7) Checked no-littering for treemacs vars, only found one.
  8) Manually added a setq for `treemacs--last-error-persist-file' const.
     (Put it in no-littering's /var dir as well.)
  9) Everything is good now.

Ideally:
  - treemacs would store all its files in one place with one variable to set maybe?
  - Or at least treemacs would add its second file to the README as a settable thing.
  - no-littering would setup all of treemacs' files' locations.
  - treemacs wouldn't keel over and die from not finding a file (or really directory)
    it expects itself to have created for it.

* Notes

Was taking notes in the .el as I was working on it so here's the code:

;; https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs
(use-package treemacs
  :defer t


  ;;:bind
  ;; bind some keys so you can get into treemacs?


  :config
  ;; Annoying error from (maybe?) no-littering/treemacs interactions...
  ;;   condition-case: Opening output file: No such file or directory,
  ;;   <path-to>/.emacs.d/.cache/treemacs-persist-at-last-error
  ;;
  ;; Treemacs wants a file at .cache/treemacs-persist-at-last-error
  ;; and there is not one so kaboom? Or is it the directory?
  ;;
  ;; Not sure that's the intended functionality for the very first call of
  ;; something treemacs related... /s
  ;; Can we move it over to no-littering next to the other one?
  ;; in no-littering.el: (setq treemacs-persist-file (var "treemacs-persist.org"))
  (setq treemacs--last-error-persist-file (no-littering-expand-etc-file-name
                                           "treemacs-persist-at-last-error.org"))
  ;; Yeah, that fixed it... Probably should try to throw that up at
  ;; no-littering in a pull request or something. Or treemacs. *shrug*
  ;; both maybe.

  ;; treemacs-persist-at-last-error.org now has this for contents:
  ;; # State when last error occured on 2019-03-05 17:45:25
  ;; # Error was 'Cannot end with a project or workspace name' in line '* Default Workspace'
  ;; 
  ;; * Default Workspace

  ;; many settings that can be set can be set here
  
  ;; The default width and height of the icons is 22 pixels. If you are
  ;; using a Hi-DPI display, uncomment this to double the icon size.
  ;;(treemacs-resize-icons 44)

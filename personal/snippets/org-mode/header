# notes: Double time stamps were being inserted. Found reason:
#   "This happens because org-insert-time-stamp inserts a time stamp (like the
# name says), but also returns the time stamp. Yasnippit inserts the return
# value but you're also left with the one inserted by the function call. A fix
# is to capture the return value, leaving only the inserted value: (let ((x
# (org-insert-time-stamp nil t t ))))."

# Can also see what we can change about `C-c C-e #'.

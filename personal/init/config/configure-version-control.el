;;      - Note that my created keys are in one place and the key used by the

;;        - GitHub app uses c:/Users/<user>/.ssh whereas I use c:/home/<user>/.ssh currently.
;;   3) Fail everything, go on a wile goose chase. Blame GitHub desktop app vs
;;      git bash, then https vs ssh, then old personal vs new company vs new person
;;      accounts/credentials/voodoo rituals...
;;      - `ssh -T git@github.com` works for seeing who GitHub thinks you are when SSHing.

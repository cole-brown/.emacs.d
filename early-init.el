;; throughout from the start, I think the new early-init.el is the best place to

;;
;; Also, it appears that some of the window settings improve startup by

;;
;; However, early-init is an Emacs 27 thing. So for Emacs 26.1 til then, we'll
;; just have to fudge things. For Emacs 27 and onward, the message above will
;; start being spit out, and eventually, decades from now, I'll notice and fix
;; things to how they should be.

## What is Org-Roam?

Org-roam is a rudimentary [Roam][roamresearch] replica built around
the all-powerful [Org-mode][org]. 

Like Roam, Org-roam offers a powerful and effortless non-hierarchical
note-taking approach. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making
note-taking fun and easy. To understand more about Roam, I recommend
the following links:

    Roam](https://reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might)
-   [Roam: Why I Love It and How I Use
    It](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam)

The goal of the project is to implement core features of Roam around
Org-mode, and eventually introduce features enabled by the Emacs
ecosystem. 

## Why build Org-Roam?

With Org-roam, you:

1. Never have to leave Emacs.
2. Can leverage all the powerful features of Org-mode: LaTeX, tables,
   and the whole to-do ecosystem (org-agenda etc.)
3. Be in full control your second brain, and access it offline. Never
   share your data with anyone

There are several packages that are similar to Org-roam, see the
[Comparison](comparison.md) page for a detailed comparison.

## Project Status

As of February 2020, it is in a very early stage of development.
